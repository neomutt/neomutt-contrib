# NeoMutt's hcache benchmark

## Introduction

The shell script and the configuration file in this directory can be used to benchmark the NeoMutt hcache backends.

## Preparation

In order to run the benchmark, you must have a directory in maildir format at hand. NeoMutt will load messages from there and populate the header cache with them. Please note that you'll need a reasonable large number of messages - >50k - to see anything interesting.

## Running the benchmark

The script accepts the following arguments

```
-e Path to the neomutt executable
-m Path to the maildir directory
-t Number of times to repeat the test
-b List of backends to test
```

Example: `./neomutt-hcache-bench.sh -e /usr/local/bin/neomutt -m ../maildir -t 10 -b "lmdb qdbm bdb kyotocabinet"`

## Operation

The benchmark works by instructing neomutt to use the backends specified with `-b` one by one and to load the messages from the maildir specified with `-m`. NeoMutt is launched twice with the same configuration. The first time, no header cache storage exists, so neomutt populates it. The second time, the previously populated header cache storage is used to reload the headers. The times taken to execute these two operations are kept track of independently.

At the end, a summary with the average times is provided.

## Sample output

```sh
$ sh neomutt-hcache-bench.sh -m ~/maildir -e ../../neomutt -t 10 -b "bdb gdbm qdbm lmdb kyotocabinet tokyocabinet"

## Notes

The benchmark uses a temporary directory for the log files and the header cache storage files. These are left available for inspection. This also means that *you* must take care of removing the temporary directory once you are done.

The path to the temporary directory is printed on standard output when the benchmark starts, e.g., `Running in /tmp/tmp.WjSFtdPf`.
